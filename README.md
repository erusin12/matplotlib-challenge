Challenge 5
The purpose of this assignment was to review studies of mice that received various treatments for cancer and evaluating their performance.  CSV files and a starter code was provided.
The first step was to review the data and get it into dataframes to review.  
Summary statistics were obtained for each drug regimen to get the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and the SEM for the tumor volume.  
Bar charts were created for the regimens by the mouse timepoints.
Pie charts for the distribution of mice by sex - male and female.
A dataframe was created for four drug regimens with the last timepoints.
Of those four treatments, the IQR was calculated to determine outliers.
A boxplot was created, showing the one outlier that existed.
One mouse was isolated to review the change in tumor volume over the timepoints.  The volume did decrease, but appeared to then increase towards the end of the treatment.
The last steps were to create a scatter plot, and then a correlation coefficient.  
This homework was completed with a starter code, assistance from the teacher, examples from class, internet resources, and a study group.
